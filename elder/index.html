<p>A long, long, time ago, in a living room far, far, away...</p>
<h2 id="humble-beginnings">Humble Beginnings</h2>
<p>...there lived a beige box with a separate hard drive that still lives in my memory. It was my first foray into technology. It was eventually followed by a colorful, oddly shaped plastic computer with a circular mouse. The Oregon Trail, The Amazon Trail, Arthur, and Candy Land all featured heavily. And I wrote on that computer all the way through high school, mostly doing word processing and basic internet stuff. Cute as it was, it didn't do well with images or rendering. </p>
<h2 id="lo-an-amateur-approacheth">Lo! An Amateur Approacheth!</h2>
<p>So I got my laptop for college, and learned how to reset the hard drive to a previous point after a misfortunate click. And then I upgraded after 6 years, a battery replacement, a charging port replacement, and a few sticky keys to a gorgeous touchscreen laptop that wouldn't die within an hour of taking it off the charging port. And still, looking back now, I didn't know what those machines were actually capable of. I'm nowhere near an expert now, of course; I'm probably at the far left side of the Dunning-Kruger graph. I'm just about to start that slide into "oh my goodness, I had no idea of how much I didn't know." </p>
<h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>
<p>This semester has been a learning experience in several ways: I did it during a global pandemic, I learned to work with people in several digitals mediums while juggling responsibilities, and I built a site that looks somewhat good. It's been hard but pretty rewarding to see the results pop up almost instantly.</p>
<h2 id="the-list-because-i-should-probably-have-one">The List, Because I Should Probably Have One</h2>
<ol>
<li>There will always be more to learn, but you can always start small.</li>
<li>Even a little is better than nothing. </li>
<li>Just start, even if you don't know where you'll end up.</li>
<li>Reach out for help.</li>
<li>I am incredibly privileged to be learning in this medium, in this time, in this country. I have abled eyes, fingers, vocal cords. I need to remember that I am not the sum total of my audience. </li>
<li>There's a digital medium that's likely to fit you. It's probably not straight up html unless you're very anal retentive.</li>
