Overview Amy Drayer gives a presentation on cognitive accessibility, which not many of us think about but is important in web page and information design. She emphasizes that there is no right type of mind or neurocognitive functioning, just as there is no right gender, race, or culture. And, if we are to design and communicate in a manner to include cognitive accessibility, then we need to make sure to include users with cognitive and learning disabilities in the usability and testing groups. The cognitive process - receiving information, processing it, and then actioning based on the results - has a number of possible restrictions that need to be considered. These are: short term memory different processing speed capabilities language restrictions social and communications issues needing literal language issues keeping or regaining focus dyscalculia Drayer provides eight objectives for designing and communicating information to an audience that may have these restrictions. Help people understand what things are and how to use them. Help people find what they need. Use clear and understandable content. Help people avoid mistakes and correct them if needed. Help people maintain focus. Ensure processes do not rely on memory Provide help and support. Support adaptation and personalization. And as an extra tip, make website changes incrementally instead of doing a complete overhaul all at once. Takeaways When we as technical communicators design web pages and graphics and communicate and layout information, we must consider that there is no \"average\" user. Designing for an \"average\" user is designing for someone who doesn't exist, and it leaves a lot of people out and unable to access or get through the information. Keeping things simple and obvious increases accessibility to information for everyone; i.e., using a consistent visual design, using common symbols such as a phone icon, an envelope for email, or a lowercase i for information, and keeping language as literal as possible. Standard website features can be barriers for accessibility, such as requiring complex passwords from memory, CAPTCHA images, and pop-up ads. All those mild annoyances like voice menus on phone calls or web pages that shift around with their ads can become real problems and turn-offs for those users with disabilities. Reflections Now that I've gone through a few of these accessibility presentations, I wish I had seen them before we did the client project. The super polished, modern look I was thinking of probably wouldn't have been the best thing to jump to. I wrote those recommendations because I was making the mistake of using myself and users like me as the standard. I thought, \"I don't have a problem with this much change, so it's fine.\" If I were to try again, I would recommend more gradual changes over time, likely starting with the missing information that was needed and clear contact information. I would have recommended mimicking the original design as much as possible, especially in the form of a sidebar for navigation instead of a horizontal one. Perhaps an email of the intended changes that could be sent out beforehand would be helpful as well. The site definitely could be more modern, but usability and accessibility are also needed features. When I work in technical communication in the future, I need to remember that I am communicating with a diverse human race. When I design for accessibility, I design for effectiveness.","title":"Markdown"},{"location":"Accessibility%20assignment/#amy-drayers-intro-to-cognitive-accessibility","text":"Contributed by Katie Elder Cognitive accessibility covers intellectual disabilities, learning disabilities, reading disabilities, and some developmental disabilities.","title":"Amy Drayer's Intro to Cognitive Accessibility"},{"location":"Accessibility%20assignment/#overview","text":"Amy Drayer gives a presentation on cognitive accessibility, which not many of us think about but is important in web page and information design.

Humble Beginnings ...there lived a beige box with a separate hard drive that still lives in my memory. It was my first foray into technology. It was eventually followed by a colorful, oddly shaped plastic computer with a circular mouse. The Oregon Trail, The Amazon Trail, Arthur, and Candy Land all featured heavily. And I wrote on that computer all the way through high school, mostly doing word processing and basic internet stuff. Cute as it was, it didn't do well with images or rendering. Lo! An Amateur Approacheth! So I got my laptop for college, and learned how to reset the hard drive to a previous point after a misfortunate click. And then I upgraded after 6 years, a battery replacement, a charging port replacement, and a few sticky keys to a gorgeous touchscreen laptop that wouldn't die within an hour of taking it off the charging port. And still, looking back now, I didn't know what those machines were actually capable of. I'm nowhere near an expert now, of course; I'm probably at the far left side of the Dunning-Kruger graph. I'm just about to start that slide into \"oh my goodness, I had no idea of how much I didn't know.\" Reflections This semester has been a learning experience in several ways: I did it during a global pandemic, I learned to work with people in several digitals mediums while juggling responsibilities, and I built a site that looks somewhat good. It's been hard but pretty rewarding to see the results pop up almost instantly. The List, Because I Should Probably Have One There will always be more to learn, but you can always start small. Even a little is better than nothing. Just start, even if you don't know where you'll end up. Reach out for help. I am incredibly privileged to be learning in this medium, in this time, in this country. I have abled eyes, fingers, vocal cords. I need to remember that I am not the sum total of my audience. There's a digital medium that's likely to fit you. It's probably not straight up html unless you're very anal retentive.","title":"My Narrative"},{"location":"elder/#my-new-digital-literacy-narrative","text":"A long, long, time ago, in a living room far, far, away...","title":"My New Digital Literacy Narrative"},{"location":"elder/#humble-beginnings","text":"...there lived a beige box with a separate hard drive that still lives in my memory.
